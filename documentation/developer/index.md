Hi there :wave:

This is the beginning of the developer documentation.

Use the sidebar to navigate this section.

- [If you are looking for how to use HACS have a look at the user documentation](/docs/user)
- [If you are looking for how to publish something that can be tracked by HACS have a look at the publisher documentation](/docs/publisher)

This integration is **massive** and there are a lot of areas to contribute to.

- [Documentation](/docs/developer/documentation)
- [Backend](/docs/developer/backend)
- [Frontend](/docs/developer/frontend)
- [Translation](/docs/developer/translation)
